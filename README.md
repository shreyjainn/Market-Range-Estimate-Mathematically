# Market Range Estimate Mathematically

This project involves developing a quantitative model to estimate the market range of the NSE Nifty 50 index. By analyzing **3 yrs** of historical data (2020â€“2023), the model provides probabilistic insights into the index's behavior and potential ranges.

## Key Features
1. **Data Analyzed**: 
   - Historical data spanning **3 yrs** from January 2020 to December 2023.
   - Focused on the closing prices of **1-month candles**, sourced from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Model Output**:
   - Probabilistic estimates of the Nifty 50 index falling within specific price ranges.
   - Data-driven predictions rooted in historical trends.

## Project Highlights
- **Skills Developed**: 
  1. Quantitative Modeling
  2. Historical Trend Analysis
  3. Probabilistic Estimation
- **Tools Used**:
  - Microsoft Excel: Data analysis and model development.
  - Yahoo Finance: Collection of historical market data.

## Deliverables
1. ** Quantitative Model**: Built to estimate market range probabilities.
2. ** Core Predictions**:
   - Historical trends of the NSE Nifty 50 index.
   - Probability-based range predictions based on historical data.

## Outcomes
This project equips traders, investors, and analysts with:
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear, data-backed predictions of market behavior.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Improved ability to identify trends and make informed investment decisions.
