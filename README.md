# Market-Range-Estimate-Mathematically

• Developed a quantitative model to estimate the market range of the NSE Nifty 50 index by analyzing 3 years of historical data(2020-2023). The project focused on evaluating closing prices of monthly candles to identify patterns and trends, using data sourced from Yahoo Finance. The analysis was conducted in Excel, enabling a systematic approach to assessing the index's performance over time.

• The model provided probabilistic insights into the likelihood of the Nifty 50 index falling within specific ranges, offering data-driven predictions based on historical trends.
